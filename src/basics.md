# Basics

When you first spawn into the server you are in the Aether. In order to go to the main world do `/rtp`

If you are not in a town you will respawn in the aether.

There is a shop in the aether at the "Ibn Battuta" npc.

All players are hidden from dynmap. If you do `/dynmap webregister` and follow the instructions to create an account and then log into the dynmap you will be able to see yourself on [Dynamic Map](https://map.mvndicraft.net/).

Mvndicraft is different from vanilla minecraft. There are no diamonds and there is no netherite. 

Instead of diamonds you will find magenetite. This is used to make many of the armors, weapons, and shields on the server. You can find these recipies on this website or by doing `/recipies`.

Potions are completely disabled on Mvndicraft and Enchants are limited. [Brewery](https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery/wiki/Recipes) is also on the server.
