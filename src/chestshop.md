# Player Shops

1. Place a chest on the ground
2. Place a sign 1 block away from the chest (for example, above it)
3. On the sign, write:

![ChestShop1](https://elwolf6.feen.us/a3jvc6.png)

  - The first line will be automatically filled with your name by the plugin (if you have the permission ChestShop.admin then you can create shops with the names of other players).
  - Second line is the amount of items to buy or sell.
  - Third line is a combination of buy and sell prices. You need to have a price indicator (like 'B' - price that will apply to items BOUGHT by PLAYERS - or 'S' - the SELL price) near the price - the prices are separated by a colon :, Some of the possible price combinations: "B 5:5 S", "B 5", "S free"
  - The forth line will hold the id/name of the item. Write ? on the sign and the item will be autofilled with the one from the chest or you can click on the sign with the item afterwards.
